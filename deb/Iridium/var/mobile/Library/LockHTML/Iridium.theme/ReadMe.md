# Iridium Details

### Sources and Dependencies
To install *Iridium*, add [my personal source](https://fiercedeity-productions.github.io/repo) to Cydia. *Iridium* depends on *Xen HTML* ([source](http://repo.incendo.ws/)) to display the widget, and *XenInfo* ([source](http://junesiphone.com/supersecret/])) to extract weather information.

### Features
*Iridium*, as demonstrated in the screenshots, has a variety of additions to just a clock, including a date view and weather display which are beautifully designed to be as concise and expressive as possible. Although *Iridium* is designed to expose your lockscreen wallpaper, it works best with a dark and blurred background, as shown in the screenshots.

### Settings
Iridium comes with an array of settings to allow you to make your lockscreen yours:

| **Setting**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                   |
|---:|:---|
| **Seconds**        	| Choose whether or not seconds past the minute are shown.                                                                                                       	|
| **Date**           	| Show or hide the date display. The numerical date is given in the locale of your device.                                                                       	|
| **Weather**        	| Display the weather. Current condition, temperature and chance of rain are displayed and periodically updated.                                                 	|
| **Chance of Rain** 	| The probability of rain is automatically hidden if at 0%, but you can choose to hide it completely whilst still showing the current condition and temperature. 	|
| **Minimal Mode**   	| An even more minimal version without borders is available, with optimized spacing.                                                                             	|
| **Clock Format**   	| Either 12hr, 24hr or set automatically to your device settings.                                                                                                	|
| **Language**       	| Currently, English and German weekday names are supported.                                                                                                        |

### Help
For the ultimate experience, use Xen HTML to hide every other element on the lockscreen: default clock, "swipe up to unlock" text, Face ID padlock, torch and camera buttons, home bar, and statusbar.

Users with an iPhone X or LittleX installed will notice a short bar in the upper-right corner when the phone is locked. This can be hidden with *NoCCBar*, available from Spark's Beta Repo (http://beta.sparkservers.co.uk/).

Despite all this, the lockscreen battery will still appear when attaching the phone to power. This can be hidden using the *LSHiddenTools10* tweak, available from BigBoss. Please note that LSHiddenTools must be activated through settings.
